## 🎯 Overview

UniSync is an AI-powered campus ecosystem that solves three major student disconnects: finding study buddies, skill exchange, and resource sharing. Built with Streamlit and powered by Google Gemini AI.

> **Note:** IIT Delhi is used as a sample campus context for demonstration purposes. UniSync can be adapted for any university.

---

## 🎯 The Problem

Students face three major disconnects on campus:
1. **Finding study buddies** - Hard to find peers with similar courses/interests
2. **Skill exchange** - Wasted potential when students can't find teachers/learners
3. **Resource sharing** - Scattered accommodation/furniture/textbook marketplaces

UniSync combines four powerful features:

- **🎓 Campus Tribe**: Tinder-style peer matching with advanced filters
- **🔄 Skill Swap**: Student-led teaching marketplace
